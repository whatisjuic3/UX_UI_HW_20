      <p>Problem: Planning beforehand is the main goal for most travelers, but it could be challenging at times which causes travelers to be distracted by how to develop a goal for the trip</p>


        <p>Solution: JRNY is developing in planning goals for a trip for travelers who need the guidance on where to start.

       <h1> Research </h1>
       <p>We began by conducting a proto persona to better understand who this app might be for.

        We then proceeded to conduct user interviews and narrowing down users would want and from there we went on to drafting how a user might discover this app and then on to drafting  some storyboards to better understand how the user might use the app.
       </p>

      <h2> Ideation </h2>
      <p>During this stage, our goal was to envision how users would interact with our app and what some of its functions would be. Our target user was an average traveler on a work trip, moving across multiple countries. 

        Since planning a trip seemed to be a major source of stress for most travelers, we aimed to create an app that would help users build their itinerary. The app would assist the user in deciding the best itinerary, taking into account their preferences and requirements.

      <h2>Wireframe & Testing</h2>
      <p>Constructing the prototype was both enjoyable and challenging. It involved taking into account all the feedback received and utilizing the problem statement to create an app that would cater to the needs of all users.

        Numerous ideas were considered, and the feedback provided by previous users was instrumental in shaping the final version of the prototype. </p>

      <h2>High Fidelity Prototype</h2>
      <p> Once a rough draft of the prototype was created, it underwent user testing to identify any missing features or potential usability issues. 

        Based on the feedback received, it was determined that improvements were necessary to enhance the app's functionality and efficiency. These improvements were made over time, resulting in a more efficient and user-friendly app. </p>

      <h2>Deliverable Design </h2>
      <p>Throughout the process of developing this project, I had a difficult time narrowing down my ideas and brainstorming to get into the mindset of the user. It wasn't until I took the time to interview people and understand their feelings that I started to grasp how to develop a plan.

        I learned that taking your time to understand the user's feelings is crucial when developing an app or anything else. It gives you a deep understanding of how you can effect positive changes in your own work.
        
        In the future, I hope to use the skill sets that I have learned to better understand clients and develop apps that cater to users' needs. I would like to create better problem statements and user insights to develop stronger projects.
